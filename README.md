# Feature Extraction

The code in this folder is designed to extract the features from our data sets. The following notebooks can be run in any order:

1. ExtractLexicalFeatures.ipynb
2. ExtractSearchFeatures.ipynb
3. ExtractSpellingAndPunctuation.ipynb
4. ExtractSyntaticalFeatures.ipynb
5. ExtractVocabFeatures.ipynb

but all must be run before running:

FeatureExtractionMain.ipynb

which aggregates the output from all the Extract[featureType].ipynb notebooks.
